A workload simulator and benchmarking tool for evaluating https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra[Ory Hydra], https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos[Ory Kratos], and https://www.ory.sh/docs/keto[Ory Keto] with https://www.cockroachlabs.com/[CockroachDB].

You can also use the https://github.com/amineelkouhen/crdb-ory-sandbox[CockroachDB + Ory Sandbox] to provision the joint environment, and execute this tool. 

This project simulate multiple workloads:

- For Ory Hydra: It creates a OAuth2 client, create multiple access tokens concurrently, then introspect these tokens at scale (multiple parallel read workers).
- For Ory Kratos: It initiates the Self-service registration flow, create identities, then check these identities / sessions.
- For Ory Keto: It simulates permission tuple insertions and checks at scale.

== 🚀 Quickstart Guide

=== 🛠️ 1. Configure Your Workload

Edit `config/config.yaml` to point to your Ory endpoints and define the test parameters like `read_ratio` and `duration_sec`.

[source,yaml]
----

  admin_api: "http://a89df209831c94b93a7c03c804133c29-578356777.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:4445"

  read_api: "http://af9bf112adc0c4ca7b628413d23b989a-1795027655.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:4466"
workload:
  read_ratio: 100             # 💡 For every write, do ~100 reads i.e. number of reads per write
  duration_sec: 120            # 💡 Run for 120 seconds, set to 0 to run indefinitely

=== ⚙️ 2. Build the Simulator

Run the following to compile the binary:

[source,bash]
----
make clean build
----

'''

=== ▶️️ 3. Run the Simulator

[source,bash]
----
./crdb-ory-load-test \
  --duration-sec=60 \
  --read-ratio=100 \
  --workload-config=config/config.yaml \
  --log-file=run.log
----

Happy benchmarking! 🧪📈

==== 📊 What Does `read_ratio Do?

This option controls *how many reads per write*:

[source,yaml]
----
read_ratio: 100
----

`read_ratio controls how many reads are triggered per write. In the example above, for every 1 write, the workload will perform approximately 100 read operations.

This simulates *real-world workloads*, where reads vastly outnumber writes.

== ❓ Why Use This Instead of Writing Directly to CockroachDB?

This tool is not a raw CockroachDB benchmark. Instead, it emulates full _application-level_ behavior by using official Ory APIs.

This approach:

✅ Tests end-to-end query paths

✅ Evaluates Ory's caching, indexing, and internal logic

✅ Produces realistic and reliable benchmarks

🚫 Avoids misleading results from skipping business logic or API-layer checks
